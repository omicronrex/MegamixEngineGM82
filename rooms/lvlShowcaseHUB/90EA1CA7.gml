text = "Welcome to the Showcase HUB. This area links to several levels designed to show off most all of the assets in the devkit and some of the things you can do with them in creation code. There are two types of showcases, boss rushes which just have some bosses and ones that show off enemies and platforming gimmicks. The latter showcases have signs scattered throughout them giving a brief explanation of each asset and in some cases some of the creation code stuff you can do with them. Unlike the MAGMML 2 Devkit these are now broken up into themed showcases, not by game. Each sign in this room contains the levels name, its creator(s) and other contributors. These files are loaded externally, but you can load them into the GMS project yourself if you want to look at the rooms."
